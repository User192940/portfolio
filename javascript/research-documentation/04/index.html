        <p>
          DOM custom events are events that are created by developers to trigger
          functionality in their applications. These events can trigger custom
          code to run or it can perform a specific action when an event occurs.

        <h2>How to Create Custom Events</h2>
        <p>
          To create a custom event, you can use the CustomEvent constructor
          provided by the DOM API. Here is an example of how to create a custom
          event:
        </p>
        <p>const customEvent = new CustomEvent('myCustomEvent', {</p>
        <p>bubbles: true,</p>
        <p>detail: { data: 'some data' } });</p>
        <p>// call the event</p>
        <p>document.dispatchEvent(customEvent);</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Why Custom Events Are Used</h2>
        <p>
          Custom events are used for a variety of situations. The most common
          are custom interactions with UI elements, third-party integration, and
          modular code. Third-party integration may consist of libraries or
          services that you may want to trigger. Modular code could be a
          different module of a codebase that you want to trigger in another
          module.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Custom events are events that are created by developers to trigger
          certain functionality in their applications. Custom events are created
          using the CustomEvent constructor provided by the DOM API. Custom
          events are used for many reasons, the top three being custom
          interactions, third-party integration, and enabling modular code to
          run seamlessly.
