        <p>
          The HTMLCollection is a generic collection of elements in order based
          on the document that has methods and properties for selecting from the
          list. The collection in the DOM is live and is automatically updated
          when the document is changed.

        <p>
          A NodeList object is a list or collection of nodes extracted from a
          document.

        <h2>Differences and Similarities</h2>
        <p>
          NodeLists and HTMLCollections are very similar. Both are lists that
          contain items from a document. The difference is that nodes are
          accessed using index numbers and elements can be accessed using name,
          id, or index number. Additionally, HTMLCollections are live
          collections that change, however, NodeLists are static collections
          that won't change with the document.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          NodeLists and HTMLCollections are very similar array-like collections
          of nodes or elements. One difference is how they are accessed in the
          code. The second key difference is that NodeLists are static lists,
          whereas, HTMLCollections are live and connected to the current
          document.
