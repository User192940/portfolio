          <p>
            The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. When placed inside
            a form element it allows for input data to not be validated upon
            submission. The method attribute specifies how form-data will be
            sent. Data can be sent with either a get or a post. Get sends the
            data as URL variables(not secure). Post sends the data through HTTP
            post transaction (secure). The action attribute specifies where the
            page will send form-data when the form is submitted.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The fieldset element draws a box inside forms to allow for
            organization. The legend tag gives the fieldset a caption.

          <p>
            The label element is for captions for items in the UI. The label has
            the attribute for. This attribute is connected to the id attribute
            of the input form control. When they are connected your site meets
            accessibility requirements. Additionally, it allows you to click on
            the label to enter the input field.

          <p>
            In short, novalidate stops data validation for form-data. The method
            attribute specifies how user input will be sent. The action
            attribute allows you to choose exactly where the data will be sent.
            Fieldset is a way to organize inputs based on similarity in forms.
            The legend tag is used to add a caption to the fieldset. The label
            element is used to add captions to UI items. And labels have for
            attributes that allow them to connect to form controls such as
            "input". To meet A11Y requirements you must have labels connected to
            inputs.
