          <h2>What is Specificity?</h2>
          <p>
            CSS specificity refers to a calculated number that determines what
            style the browser will end up using. Higher specificity values mean
            it is more important.

          <h2>Contrast Ratios</h2>
          <p>
            A contrast ratio is the ratio of brightness between the brightest
            shade and the darkest shade. In the real world, it tells us the
            difference between two colors. If the number is low then the colors
            are closer in appearance. If it is higher then they are more
            different in appearance.

          <h2>Importance of Contrast Ratios</h2>
          <p>
            Contrast ratios are important to pay attention to for multiple
            reasons. First, they affect the appearance of a site. Usually, a
            higher contrast ratio between the background and text is more
            visually appealing. Second, many people are visually impaired and
            cannot tell the difference between low-contrast ratio colors. If you
            fail to meet the legal standard you or your company can be sued.

          <h2>Who Sets Accessibility Rules?</h2>
          <p>
            The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are developed by the
            Accessibility Guidelines Working Group which is a part of the W3C.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            There are many things to keep in mind when making websites. In this
            documentation, I covered CSS specificity, contrast ratios, and who
            set the accessibility rules.
