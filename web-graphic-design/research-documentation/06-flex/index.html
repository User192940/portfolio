            W3Schools provides a basic summary of what flexbox is. The webpage
            also links to other pages that explain flexbox properties in depth.

          <p>
            MDN explains everything there is to know about flexbox. It describes
            the two axes of flexbox, starts and end lines, flex containers, flex
            items, etc.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            CSS flexible box is a display property for HTML elements. It allows
            you to customize the layout of your page in any way you can imagine.
            It allows you to choose which way you want content to start and end.
            There are properties that affect how items will grow or shrink
            depending on what you select. The three sources I linked to were
            CSS-Tricks, MDN, and W3Schools. I think that CSS-Tricks is the best
            resource for flexbox because it has images for every setting to show
            you how things are affected by the stylesheet.
