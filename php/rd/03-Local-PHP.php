    <h1> Local PHP </h1>
    <p>One way to run PHP locally is to open the command prompt and type php -S localhost:8000. Next you go to a browser and go to localhost:8000 to see your code.
        
</p>
        <p> The second way to run PHP locally is by using the command php -S 0.0.0.0: (PORT_NUMBER)
</p>
        <p>The third way is to install WAMP. WAMP is a software stack that allows users to code on their local device without the consequences of working with their serverâ€™s code. WAMP has a control panel that makes running a live server easy.
</p>
        <p> Pros of running PHP locally:
<ul>
<li>Get live feedback for code</li>
<li>No security risks</li>
<li>Easy to setup</li>
</ul>
Cons of running PHP locally:
<ul>
<li>The environment might be different than the server which may lead to complications</li>
<li>Local PHP is single-threaded by default which will stall when a request is blocked</li>
</ul>
