                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    The target audience is peers, instructors, and hiring managers. The design compels users to interact with the images that are presented on the index page. After that, they are guided to the bottom of the page. There they can go to a few different pages by clicking on one of the list items. The design is simple to make users not have to think about what to do next. It also provides portfolios based on degree for organizational purposes.                </p>
                <h2>The Message</h2>
                <p>
                    The message is that users can count on us to present student portfolios in an elegant manner and unbiased manner. The design supports this by showing portfolios from different disciplines on the home page. Additionally, users can select portfolios based on degree.
                </p>
                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to guide users to student portfolio presentations and to get conversions on our form. The portfolios are always the main section of the page. They are staring you right in the face wherever you turn. So it's hard not to look. The form on the contact page is designed to be minimal to make the barrier to entry as low as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>The Calls To Action</h2>
                <p>
                    There are three calls to action on the website. The first is the clickable portfolio images. On hover a grain effect is added to inform users of interactability. The second is the large red cards with white text. They stand out against the all-blue theme thus far, prompting users to interact. The last call to action is the two form buttons on the contact page. They stand out because they are nonconforming to the established motif.
                </p>
                <h2>Design Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    For the layout, I decided to go with a topbar navigation and a full-width wrapper. For the wrapper contents, I decided to use a grid because it is easy to adjust individual containers if needed. I tried a red and maroon theme at first but it ended up looking too aggressive. So I decided to add adjacent colors on the color wheel and it worked out. For the typography, I wanted something that would be reminiscent of an old newspaper. After some searching, I decided Allerta Stencil was perfect.
