                <p>The code is easy to read and the HTML is semantic. I notice they have links to javascript at the top and the bottom of the DOM. I notice they also have an SEO plugin to optimize their index on search engines.   </p>

                <h2>User Interface</h2>
                <img alt="picture of envylabs homepage" src="../images/user-interface.webp"/>
                <p>The UI is very pleasing to look at. At the top of the page, you have a simple navbar. When you scroll the page has some animation effects that seamlessly connect the intro to the projects section. The boxes have a nice hover effect that isn't too stimulating. </p>

                <img alt="envylabs card that links to cisco project" src="../images/ux.webp"/>
                <p>The user experience is great. During my visit, I never got lost or had to think of how I was going to do something. The code showed that it was accessible. They show that they are trustworthy through studies. Even though I'm not a client, I left satisfied. </p>
