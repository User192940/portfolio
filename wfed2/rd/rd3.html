                    <p> Can I use website is dedicated to showing developers what browsers and versions their CSS, HTML, JS, and SVG is compatible with. It tells you what browsers don't support the feature. Additionally, it shows the percentage of gloabl users that have access to the feature.</p>

                <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first use is the most basic, check the compatibility of some feature you want to use. The second use is to compare browsers to see what you can implement for browsers that don't support the feature. The third use is to test your website for compatibility across 2000+ browsers. The fourth use is to import data from Google Analytics and see what browsers your website's users are using.

                    <p>
                        :has() is a relational psuedo class. You can select elements containing specific content using this. For example div:has(img) selects all img inside div. I found the CSS has() property compatibility interesting because I have used it before. I didn't realize that around 15% of users won't be able to use it.

                <a href="https://caniuse.com/passkeys">
                    <p>
                        Passkeys or multi-device FIDO credentials, are used instead of passwords because it is easier to use and more secure. Creating passkeys involves the backend, frontend, browser, and authentication. I found this interesting because I have never heard of passkeys before. It is important to note that around 17% of users will not be able to use this feature.
