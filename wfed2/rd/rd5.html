                <p>
                    CSS-TRICKS' guide to Flexbox is my go-to. It is focused on delivering information visually. It contains everything there is to know about flexbox, flex containers, and flex items. Additionally, it has sections dedicated to fixing bugs, flexbox tricks, and more. If you are a visual learner, this is the resource for you.

                    <p>
                        W3Schools has multiple pages dedicated to Flexbox, flex containers, flex items, and responsive layouts. The pages are organized, informative, and visual. The flex containers page contains information about flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, and align-content. The flex items page contains information about the order, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, align-self, and flex. The responsive layouts page contains information about media queries and responsive images.

                    <p>
                        Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model. It deals with the layout in either columns or rows. Flex-direction defines the main axis. Options are row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse. There is information about directions and corresponding images to help visualize it. Overall the MDN documentation covers everything that you would expect a high-quality resource to cover on Flexbox or any CSS property.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many resources available for learning Flexbox. The three resources that I have listed are the top 3 according to Google. They all contain similar information about flexbox, flex containers, flex items, and responsive designs. Which resource you use comes down to personal preference. I prefer CSS-TRICKS because it is visual and organized.
