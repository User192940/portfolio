                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@codecommerce">Code Commerce</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Code Commerce is a YouTuber that makes videos all about web development. He guides people through their first projects on various frameworks. He does what he does because he was unsatisfied with web development content when he started programming. I found the source by chance. I was scrolling on YouTube and it recommended his videos to me. 
                </p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship">Fireship</a></h2>
                <p>Fireship is another YouTuber but he makes short-form videos about development as a whole. His videos pack in as much information as possible in the least amount of time. He does what he does because he noticed that a lot of content around development wasn't concise and efficient enough for him. I found him via the YouTube algorithm as well. </p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingPhase">CodingPhase</a></h2>
                <p>CodingPhase is a developer who makes YouTube videos and runs his own business. His primary focus is on educating people on topics that will get them front-end positions in IT. Joe noticed that a lot of people in the industry were focusing on teaching skills rather than getting people jobs. So he made his own brand centered on teaching the most relevant things for ambitious individuals looking to get into the industry. Big surprise, CodingPhase was also found via the algorithm.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Many people dedicate themselves to providing the most relevant knowledge about almost anything on the internet. In this article, I wrote about dedicated individuals who provide recent development/programming knowledge. They specialize in different things but are worth checking out for their unique personalities and tips and tricks. </p>
