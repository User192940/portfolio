                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Serverless hosting is a form of hosting where the client only has to worry about their code and what it does. All the server software and hardware management is taken on by a third party. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why Serverless?</h2>
                <p>Serverless means less stress and work for the developer. You, as a developer, focus on the individual functions in your application. Also, serverless is more cost-effective. Since everything is broken down into functions. You only pay when your functions are requested, rather than always having the application on. </p>

                </p>
                <h2><a href="https://cloud.google.com/serverless">Google Cloud</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud: Google Cloud provides a fully managed serverless platform that automatically scales your services up or down. It includes products like Cloud Run, which allows you to build applications in your favorite language, and Cloud Functions, which lets you write and run small code snippets that respond to events. GCP comes with a free 2 million monthly requests. After that, it is $0.40 for every 1 million additional requests. 
                </p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Serverless hosting is an efficient, cost-effective way of hosting your applications. Developers don't worry about the server environment at all. Giving them more time to focus on the code that really matters. Two popular serverless providers are AWS and Google. </p>
