## About

Serverless hosting is a form of hosting where the client only has to worry about their code and what it does. All the server software and hardware management is taken on by a third party.

## Why Serverless?

Serverless means less stress and work for the developer. You, as a developer, focus on the individual functions in your application. Also, serverless is more cost-effective. Since everything is broken down into functions. You only pay when your functions are requested, rather than always having the application on.
